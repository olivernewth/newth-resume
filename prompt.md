# AI Generation Prompt

I am providing a job description. Take the latex resume below and generate a new one in the folder generated, first the .tex file named after the job, and then use it to make the PDF.

The template is template/resume.tex.

Copy it, and make a full .tex file that doesnt produce any errors.
